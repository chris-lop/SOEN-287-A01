            <h1>Christopher Lopez</h1>
            <p>Undergraduate Computer Science student at Concordia University seeking a software developer internship. Experienced in object-oriented programming and web development.</p>

            <p>My coursework at Concordia University has exposed me to an extensive amount of technical knowledge and has allowed me to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, as I always strive to improve my skillset, I have also gathered a substantial amount of hands-on experience through the creation of several side projects in Java.</p>
            <p>Being fully trilingual, I have always had exceptional communication skills that have allowed me to collaborate and share my ideas with others. This allowed me to thrive during the 2017-2018 JA Quebec Company Program, where I was elected by my team as the Vice-President Finance of our company and went on to win the award of the best Vice-President Finance in the entirety of the Greater-Montreal Region.</p>
            <p>After acquiring my Business Administration Technical Certificate at Vanier College, I have also developed and mastered many essential business skills that have allowed me to stand out as a candidate in this industry. I strongly believe that versatility goes a long way in the workplace as it allows me to have a deeper understanding when faced with a problem and provides me with many more tools to deal with any issue I might encounter.</p>
